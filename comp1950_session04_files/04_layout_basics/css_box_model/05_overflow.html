			<p>If there is a problem with content escaping box models you should first consider if there are more effective ways to style it so that it won't happen.</p>
			<p>For example, fixed height box models can fall prey to this issue. It's usually best to allow box models to :auto assign height, being as tall as they need ot be to present the content contained therin.</p>	
			<p>Otherwise, the overflow:hidden; property can be assigned to clip the escaping content.</p>
			<p>Change the width of your browser to demonstrate the problem.</p>
			<p>Alter the code with overflow:hidden; and test again.</p>
