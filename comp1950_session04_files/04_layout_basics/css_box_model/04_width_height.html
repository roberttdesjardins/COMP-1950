	<p>Block elements are 100% width by default.</p>

		<div id="fixed-width">Fixed Width (500px;)</div>

		<div id="default-height">Default Height is determined by content, padding, border</div>
		<div id="fixed-height">
			Fixed Height (500px;)
			<div id="percent-height">Percentage Height determined by parent container (100%). Note how it is exactly as tall as the parent, even if overlaping occurs.</div>

		<h2>Browser height</h2>
		<p>The grey container div is set to 100% height, but since percentage height is determined by the parent element, it is only as tall as the body/html.</p>
		<p>An HTML document is only as tall as the content requires. To make it be as tall as the browser, the html and body tags should also be set to 100% height.</p>
