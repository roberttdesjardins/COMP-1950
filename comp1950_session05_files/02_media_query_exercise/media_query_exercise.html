		<h1>Media Queries</h1>

		<p>Examine the .css source code, note the @media queries to see how the width detection is functioning. Be sure to alter the width of your browser to trigger different media queries.</p>
		<p>Implement the same functionality testing for height and orientation.</p>
		
		<h3>Width detection...</h3>
		<div id="widescreen">Viewport has 1600px or greater width available</div>
		<div id="fullscreen">Viewport is 1024-1599px wide</div>
		<div id="medium">Viewport is 500-1023px wide</div>
		<div id="thin">Viewport is less than 500px wide</div>
		
		<h3>Is the browser tall or short?</h3>
		<div><span id="tall">Tall - viewport is taller than 499px</span><span id="short">Short - viewport is shorter than 500px</span></div>
		
		<h3>Landscape or Portrait?</h3>
		<div><span id="landscape">Landscape</span><span id="portrait">Portrait</span></div>
